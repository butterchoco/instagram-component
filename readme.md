# Instagram Component/Widget (Next/React Based)

I create this instagram component so that people can use it in their website. It is built with Next Js but basically it's just an html and javascript code with axios package installed. Currently, it only contains instagram profile. This project will be improved as time goes by. If you want to contribute in this project, feel free to pull request this project.

## Installation

Just like any other Next Js Project, you need to install npm or yarn first. Then do some installation command:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

You can either import the file and give props (username) or you can just take the file and ignore the installation.
